# Ports and adapters / hexagonal architecture
A toy example. In Django.

In this project I play with:
- writing ports and adapters code in a Django project
- writing a django project and turning it into a ports and adapters architecture.


## Books
The books app in this project was written as a domain model first and then brought in to Django.


## Libraries
This app was written as a Django project first. I intend to experiment with converting that to ports + adapters, probably via extracting Command objects from the views.
